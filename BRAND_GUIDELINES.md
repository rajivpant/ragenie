## Brand Story

### Origin

RaGenie evolved from "Ragbot" - a Retrieval Augmented Generation chatbot. The rebrand represents a significant architectural evolution from a simple chatbot to a sophisticated agentic AI platform capable of augmenting human capabilities across diverse tasks.

### Name Meaning

**RaGenie** cleverly combines:
- **RAG** = Retrieval Augmented Generation (the core technology)
- **Genie** = A magical assistant that grants wishes and helps humans

The capital G emphasizes the "Genie" aspect - RaGenie is your AI genie, ready to assist with knowledge work, research, coding, writing, and complex problem-solving.

## Taglines and Messaging

### Primary Tagline

### Positioning Statement
